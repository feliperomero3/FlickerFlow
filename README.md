# FlickerFlow

Inspired by the book [Bootstrapping Microservices Second Edition][1] by Ashley Davis (Manning, 2024).

FlickerFlow is a simple video-streaming service that delivers video to a user watching in a web browser.

Our application will contain services for video streaming, storage, and upload, plus a gateway for the customer-facing frontend.
The users can view a list of videos. From there, they can select a video, and it will begin playing.
